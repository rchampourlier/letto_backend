# Letto

**Letto is a work-in-progress!!!**

## Objective

With Letto, I want to make it easier to build a custom workflow
to trigger automated processes based on the events triggered by
web services.

It's like IFTTT or Zapier, but developer-oriented, where you
would be able to do anything by writing code, but with the
ease-of-use of a dedicated SAAS tool (so no code deployment,
no developing interactions components, no handling authentication...),
you just focus on the workflow you want to create!
